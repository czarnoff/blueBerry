Car indicator system based on Raspberry pi.

Descripton
----------
My old truck could be spruced up with new custom indicators.  The plan is to use something like neopixels or other LED light strips to create animated rear break / turn / reverse indicators.  The hope is to use a combination of Raspberry Pi and Tensy boards.
